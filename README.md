# hilbertmodularforms

Implementation to compute graded rings of Hilbert modular forms in [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/).

## Tests

Example computations that are run during CI via `run_tests.m`.
These examples can also be executed via

```{shell}
magma/Tests/filename.m
```

## Examples

These files are similar to what is found in Tests, but not run during CI.

## WorkInProgress

Examples that may or may not run successfully, but have code or comments that may be useful or informative.
Once a file has been polished and appropriate for public consumption it can be moved to Examples or Tests.
